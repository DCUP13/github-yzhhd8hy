He was very engaged and wanted to meet a few times via zoom and phone before we wanted to start looking to meet my family and learn our wants, needs and dislikes. He is extremely personable and very easy to talk to. He would frequently send us listings, to see what we liked and did not like. When we found our dream house, he went above, and beyond when we told him this was the one we wanted. This involved many late-night texts and phone calls. He walked me through every step and made it very easy and clear. Not once did I ever feel pressured or uncomfortable. He even recommended I submit a lower bid which ending up winning. I recommended him for my family and for all buyers, new and old. When and if I move again, I know I already have my guy.",
